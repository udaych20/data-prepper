# OTel Trace Raw Processor

This is a processor that receives collection of [Span](../../data-prepper-api/src/main/java/com/amazon/dataprepper/model/trace/Span.java) records sent from [otel-trace-source](../dataPrepper-plugins/otel-trace-source), does stateful processing on extracting and filling-in trace group related fields.

> Note: `otel_trace_raw` processor has been renamed to `otel_traces`. You can use either name for now but the support for `otel_trace_raw` will be removed in major version 3.0.

## Usages
Example `.yaml` configuration
```
processor:
    - otel_trace_raw:
```

## Configuration

* `trace_flush_interval`: An `int` represents the time interval in seconds to flush all the descendant spans without any root span. Default to 180.
* `trace_group_cache_ttl`: A `Duration` represents the time-to-live for traces in the trace group cache. Defaults to 15 seconds.
* `trace_group_cache_max_size`: An `int` representing the total number of traces to keep in the trace group cache.

## Metrics
In addition to the metrics from [AbstractProcessor](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/blob/main/data-prepper-api/src/main/java/org/opensearch/dataprepper/model/processor/AbstractProcessor.java):

* `traceGroupCacheCount` - (gauge) The count of trace groups in the trace group cache
* `spanSetCount` - (gauge) The count of span sets in the span set collection
